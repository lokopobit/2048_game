# 2048_game
OOP implementation of the famous game 2048 in python (GUI is not available)  


## Rules of the game

At the beginning there is a 4x4 board with 2 pieces randomly located. The pieces can be the number 2 or the number 4 (initially). When pressing left, rigth, up or down keys  the pieces move in that direction. If in one of these movements two pieces clash then the become one piece but of double value. After avery movement a new piece appears (with value 2 or 4; value 2 is more probable). The score is updated after each move with the value of the resulting fusion.  

If we try to move in an impossible direction then no new piece is generated.
